    <h1> History of Karnataka</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    The History of Karnataka goes back several millennia. Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and have contributed greatly to the history, culture and development of Karnataka as well as the entire Indian subcontinent. The Chindaka Nagas of central India Gangas, [1] Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta,[note 1] Chalukyas of Vengi,[2] Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada origin[3] who later took to encouraging local

In the medieval and early modern periods, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate became the major powers in Karnataka. The latter disintegrated to form five Deccan Sultanates. The Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. <br>

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha Empire ruled most of present-day Karnataka. Maratha rule was most fortified in the northern regions of present-day Karnataka. The first Maratha expeditions in the region were led by Chhatrapati Shivaji.[4] As Maratha power weakened in the 1780s, the Kingdom of Mysore began occupying lands in Southern Karnataka.

After the Anglo-Mysore Wars, where the East India Company defeated the forces of Tipu Sultan, Company Rule began in India. Karnataka was divided between the Bombay Presidency, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Nizam of Hyderabad.

India became Independent in 1947, and according to the States Reorganization Act, 1956, the Kannada-speaking areas of Hyderabad State, Madras State were unified with Mysore State. The state was renamed as Karnataka in 1973.

    <h2><b>Pre-historic Karnataka</b></h2>
        <p>The pre-historic culture of southern India, including Karnataka, is known as the hand-axe culture, in contrast to the Sohan pre-historic culture of northern India. In southern India, palaeolithic hand-axes made with quartz and quartzite have been found in many different places. <br><br>

            One example of a pre-historic archaeological site in Karnataka is Kibbanahalli, where archaeologists have found a variety of early stone-age tools, including hand-axes and guillotine chisels. The findings are on display at the museum of the Geology Department of the Central College, Bangalore. <br>
            
            Two other notable pre-historic sites in Karnataka are Maskin in the Raichur district and Brahmagiri in the Chitradurga district. Both sites show evidence of domesticated animals, including dogs, cows and sheep. The people who lived here used weapons made from copper and bronze, and adorned themselves with rings, earrings, bangles, and bead necklaces.</p>
    <img id="image" width="600px"src="https://www.ourkarnataka.com/wp-content/uploads/Karnataka-history.jpg"> <br>In Karnataka started using a variety of iron tools, including sickles, arrows, swords, and hammers. <hr>
<h2><b>Dynasties</b></h2>
<p>
    Several great dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and impacted the culture in various ways, and in some cases, dynasties of Kannada origin expanded outside Karnataka. Notable examples of Karnataka dynasties are the Chindaka Nagas of central India Gangas, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, the Chalukyas of Vengi, and the Yadavas of Devagiri. <br><br>

In the medieval and early modern eras, the two major powers in Karnataka were the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate. The sultanate eventually broke up into five Deccan Sultanates, before defeating the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565.

<h2><b>The British East India Company</b></h2>
<p>
    During the three last decades of the 1700s, the Anglo-Mysore Wars raged as the British East India Company sought to subjugate the Kingdom of Mysore. In this region, the British EIC was chiefly represented by the Madras Presidency and allied with the Maratha Empire, the Kingdom of Travancore ,and the Nizam of Hyderabad. <br><br>

    In 1799, the hous of Hyder Ali and Tipu was defeated and the Kindgom of Mysore dismantled. This marked the start of Company Rule in Karnataka. In 1858, formal rule under the British Crown commenced. <br><br>

<h2><b>Indian Independence</b></h2>
<p>
    After Indian Independence in 1947, the Indian government began reorganizing the geographical administration of the country based on language-regions. In 1956, the States Reorganization Act took the Kannada-dominated parts of Hyderabad State and Madras State and used them to form the new Mysore State, where Kannada was the official language of administration. In 1973, the name was changed from Mysore State to Karnataka State.
